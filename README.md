# Ride Hailing Service Backend: Machine Coding Problem

We need to build a backend for the ride hailing platform like Uber. Come up with working runnable code for it.

## Mandatory Functional Requirements:

- Register a user

-   Register a driver

-   Book a ride if any driver is available within a certain radius. Think about what kind of flow you want to implement.

-   Complete a ride and get the cost for it.

-   Update location of a cab.

-   Implement a tiered pricing strategy: one of the examples could be -

    - Minimum ride price - 50 rs

    - First 2 KMs at 10 Rs / KM

    - 3-5 KMs at 8 Rs / KM

    - 6 KM and beyond at 5 rs / KM

  - Show ride history for a user: ongoing and completed rides.

  - Show ride history for a driver: ongoing and completed rides.


## Bonus Requirements:

### Add support for different types of cars.

-   Sedan and Hatchback cars.

-   Different pricing rates for hatchback and sedan.

-   When hailing a cab, if hatchback is not available upgrade the user to a sedan at no extra cost.


### Add support for coupon codes.

-   Add a coupon code

-   Delete a coupon code

-   Apply a valid coupon code when starting a ride to get it at the discounted price.
